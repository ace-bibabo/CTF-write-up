# Mod 26 & 13

* I attempted two straightforward questions on picoCTF, both of which were based on ROT13, a special case of the Caesar cipher that originated in ancient Rome.

* Initially, I encountered the text "cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}," which resembled the word "flag" and needed to be decoded to "picoCTF" by applying the ROT13 cipher. I also noticed the reversal of the first two characters, "c" and "p," which indicated a specific pattern. By deducing similar mappings for the remaining letters, I managed to decode the other words to obtain our flag.
