|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**                   | The binary is for a 64-bit architecture and uses little-endian byte ordering, where the least significant byte is stored first.     |
| **RELRO**                          | No `RELRO` protection is enabled. When `Full RELRO` is enabled, the Global Offset Table (GOT) becomes read-only, preventing attacks like GOT overwriting. Without `RELRO`, the GOT is writable at runtime, making it vulnerable. |
| **Stack Canary**                   | Stack canaries help detect stack buffer overflow attacks by placing a known value (canary) before the return address on the stack. If the canary is altered, it indicates a buffer overflow, and the program terminates. Without stack canaries, the binary is vulnerable to stack overflow attacks. |
| **NX (No-eXecute)**                | `NX` marks memory regions like the stack and data segments as non-executable, preventing injected shellcode from being executed. With `NX enabled`, typical buffer overflow attacks that inject and execute shellcode are more difficult to perform. |
| <span style="color:red">**PIE (Position Independent Executable)**</span> | <span style="color:red">Without `PIE`, the binary's code and data segments are loaded at fixed addresses, making them predictable targets for ROP attacks. With `PIE`, addresses are randomized each time the binary is executed, making it harder for attackers to predict addresses of functions or gadgets.</span> |
| **Shadow Stack (SHSTK)**           | SHSTK is an additional stack that stores return addresses separately. It compares the return address on the shadow stack with the one on the normal stack to detect tampering. If a mismatch is detected, the program will terminate, protecting against return address manipulation attacks. |
| **Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT)** | IBT adds control-flow integrity checks for indirect branches (e.g., `call` or `jmp` instructions) to prevent attackers from redirecting execution to unintended or malicious code. |
| **Stripped**                       | The binary is not stripped, meaning it still contains debugging symbols and function names. This makes it easier to analyze and debug, but it also reveals more information to attackers. |
